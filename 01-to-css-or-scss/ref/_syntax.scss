div {
  // Selector, just as you would in CSS
}

div span {
  // CSS child selectors are also supported
}

div {
  span {
    // But you can also nest them like so!
    // Rules in this block compile to "div span"
  }
}

div {
  &.blue {
    // The & refers to the element of the current block, so this compiles to div.blue
    // This is useful for de-duplication, readability and pseudo elements

    &:before {
      // here a pseudo element is defined, compiles to: "div.blue:before"
    }
  }
}

div.blue {
  div & {
    // You can do fancy stuff with the & selector, like shown here
    // This compiles to "div div.blue", so it's not the usual 'top to bottom' flow
    // While this can be useful, it can be confusing and you may have to split up nested code to get the desired effect
