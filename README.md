# CSS Tutorial

This project hosts the [iAdvise](https://www.iadvise.eu/) - education SCSS/HTML tutorial.

## Let's do this!

I recommend you start with [Chapter 0: Getting Started](./00-getting-started) to get your development environment set
 up.

## Downloading

If you do not have GIT set up, download it from the git-scm website: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Install it, open `Git GUI` from the installation directory or start menu, click `Help`, `Show SSH Key` and `Generate Key`. If you want you can click `Copy to Clipboard` and add it to your personal GitHub account.
Next, clone the repository. To do this, open up commandline after install git, navigating to the parent folder (I recommend something like `C:/Development`) and typing `git clone git@github.com:Rescla/css-tutorial.git`. From here follow the instructions in chapter 0.
